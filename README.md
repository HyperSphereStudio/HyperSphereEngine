# HyperSphereEngine

Created by Johnathan Bizzano

This is my latest version of my Server-Client Java Library which contains all libraries and other utilities I use in my own Server/Client projects such as creating MMORPG games.
I am a new developer so my code does contains bugs (especially since I just updated the graphics to a new system!); however, I feel there is alot in this library that other developers can use for a multitude of projects.

I have added my own private forks to this engine such as a kryonet fork that allows for JVM-JVM communication (perhaps Java-Python communication in the future!), batch sending single serialization and alot more

I will over the next coming weeks add manuals on how to use this. If any developer would like to assist
in improving this library for the benefit of the community feel free! The two main libraries are not yet added to github but I will release in the next coming weeks.


This library uses libgdx cross-platform capability to run on desktop, IOS and Android.

I have personally made a fully working Server/Client MMORPG 2D Game from this library which I am hoping to roll out in the future.

This library is large, so I added my version of progaurd.txt for android and desktop in case you want to remove unused classes.

This library has a heavy pipeline around graphics and other things; however, it also has tools to allow more advanced developers to alter this anyway they want to.

Many of the libraries are for 2D MMORPG Games as that is what I have mainly used it for, but many different variations of networks can be created from this.

A few of the contents inside include:
     Collections Libraries
     Math Libraries
     Networking Libraries (TCP, UDP, Email, Pushnotifications)
     Texture Manipulation (Packing, Advanced Object Recognition Splitting, etc)
     Graphic Libraries 
     Coding Libraries (Groovy, HyperScript(The engine has its own simple code you can use that allows for runtime interpretation), Reflection)
     Android Libraries
     File Handling Libraries (JSON etc)
     Encryption Libraries
     Analytics Libraries
